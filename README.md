# Hello World!

![banner](https://github.com/vidyap-xgboost/vidyap-xgboost/blob/master/banner.png)

This is Vidya. I have done my **Masters in Physics** and eventually found my love for **Data** which lead me to pursue career in **Data Science**. 

I am a beginner at coding but a fast learner too! To make coding as a habit, I have started #100DaysOfCode and #100DaysOfMLCode on my personal Twitter account. I'm currently pursuing courses on DataCamp and you can [have a look at profile](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/vidyapb) to see my progress! 

I usually work on Python projects or Data Science projects to improve my coding skills. I'm also interested in **Data Collection/Web Scraping** and I upload and updated them time to time on my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/vidyapb) (Feel free to work on them!). 

I write articles related to **Data Science and Productivity** on [my Medium account](https://medium.com/@vidyapb). I share about interesting libraries and **open source projects** on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vidyapb/). 

Please feel free to connect with me on any of these platforms! You can also drop an e-mail at **vidya@fiolabs.ai**. I would love to learn from you!

I have recently started my journey in contributing towards open-source projects and pulled my first request (and merged!) on 14th of July, 2020 for [TextHero](https://github.com/jbesomi/texthero) (don't forget to check this out!). I'm currently working on [Monk AI Toolkit](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1) which is a low code Deep Learning tool and a unified wrapper for Computer Vision.

Thanks for reading till here! Please go ahead and explore my Repositories!
